Hey fellow computer enthusiast/bored kid, Noob highschool programmer here.

````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

I made a program which converts: example sentence

into: eXaMpLe SeNtEnCe

and copies it to your clipboard. It saves the tidious work of writing it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requirements:
Python 3.6 and above (www.python.org/downloads)
pyperclip module (go to your terminal and type 'pip install pyperclip')

If anyone feels like they can make my code better then they
are warmly invited into doing so. Just leave a comment on my GitHub somewhere
